This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Firebase Realtime Database where an 'offline' error is thrown despite a persistent internet connection. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. The `bug.js` file contains code that interacts with the database, and `bugSolution.js` offers potential workarounds to mitigate the problem.  This bug impacts application reliability by causing unexpected failures in data synchronization.
