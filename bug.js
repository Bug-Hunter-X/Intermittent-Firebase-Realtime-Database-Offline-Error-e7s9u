The Firebase Realtime Database client sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Error: The operation couldn't be performed because the client is offline.` error even when the device has an active internet connection.  This occurs inconsistently and seemingly at random. The error isn't consistently reproducible through repeated tests and doesn't appear related to any specific operation or data size.
