The exact cause of this intermittent issue remains elusive; it's likely related to network conditions or Firebase's internal handling of network requests. The most reliable solution is to implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  Instead of directly handling the error, implement exponential backoff and retry logic. This gives the network time to recover and increases the chance of successful data synchronization.  Additionally, consider using a status monitoring mechanism to track network connectivity. 

```javascript
function performDatabaseOperation(operation) {
  return operation().catch(error => {
    if (error.code === 'offline') {
      console.log('Network error. Retrying...');
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(performDatabaseOperation(operation)), 2000); // Exponential backoff
      });
    }
    throw error; // Re-throw other errors
  });
}

// Example usage:
performDatabaseOperation(() => firebase.database().ref().set({...})) .then(...) .catch(...);
```
